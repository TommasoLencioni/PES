# With this test I want to show how the initial arrangement of the users affect the overall performance on the short run
## The parameters adopted are
- presence of absence of an arrangement in quadrant
- short and long simulation time

## Observations
The idea was to justify the placement of the edge data center with the presence of a large number of users.

We can observe that an initial placement of user in the quadrants in which I divided the area of simulation grants a advantage in terms of tasks executed.
I wanted to focus on differences also for long runs where the initial placement of user impacts less.
As expected the advantage taken at start is mantained stable during the course of the simulation.
