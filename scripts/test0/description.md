# With this test I want to show how different orchestrator algorithm affect the results of the simulation
## The parameters adopted are
- Edge and Leader orchestrator deployment
- Different number of users 
- Different seeds
- 10 iteretion for every configuration to reduce variance

Observation:
The simulation time and generated tasks are the same.
