# With this test I want to show how different simulation duration doesn't affect the results of the simulation
## The parameters adopted are
- Edge and Leader orchestrator deployment
- Different simulation times
- Different seeds
- 10 iteretion for every configuration to reduce variance

Observation:
The failure rate is stable in time.
